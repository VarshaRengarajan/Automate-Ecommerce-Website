# Automate-Ecommerce-Website
**Description:**

Flipkart is an e-commerce platform, and they have launched a new feature to search for a product in a particular category. Once the product is searched, Flipkart displays it as a list of product items. To enhance the performance of the application, Flipkart has implemented lazy loading. It displays only a few products that can come on the screen.
To display or load more products, the user must scroll down.
As a Test Engineer, you are expected to test this feature end-to-end.

**Detailed Scenario:**

- Navigate to the Flipkart homepage (https://www.flipkart.com/)
- Determine a page load time with a performance test
- Search for a product, say, “iPhone 13” under the “Mobile” category
- Check if the images are loaded and visible till the screen height only
- Check if the page has a scroll feature
- Check the frequency at which the content will be refreshed while scrolling
- Verify that the image is downloaded just before the user scrolls to its position and gets displayed in time
- Verify that it navigates to the bottom of the page
- Check whether different browsers and screen resolutions render it the same way
 
**Tools Required:**

- Selenium Library
- Eclipse IDE
- TestNG Library
- Maven
